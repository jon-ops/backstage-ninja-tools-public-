# Backstage Ninja Tools

**Backstage Ninja Tools** is a growing suite of practical PowerPoint add-ins built for **live events graphics operators** and production teams.

These are no-nonsense tools designed to make PowerPoint behave properly on show day — when the room is full, the clock is loud, and "it worked on my laptop" is not an option.
