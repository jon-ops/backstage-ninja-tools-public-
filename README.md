## What do the tools do?

Backstage Ninja Tools currently include a set of focused utilities designed to solve common live-events PowerPoint problems, including:

- **Font Checker** — scan a presentation to see which fonts are used and identify missing fonts before show day  
- **Speaker Notes tools** — clean up, format, and manage notes so presenters can actually read them on-site  
- **Slide and asset exports** — export slides, images, and video at proper resolutions and frame rates for live playback  
- **Media and asset inspection** — identify and collect images, video, and other embedded content used in a deck  
- **Live-events utilities** — small, practical tools that reduce last-minute surprises and operator stress  

A current overview of available tools can always be found at:

## Individual tools

Some tools are developed and maintained in their own repositories, for example:

- **PPT Font Checker**  
  Detect fonts used in slides and identify missing fonts before show day  
  https://github.com/jon-ops/ppt-font-checker

More tools will be added over time as they earn their place in real show workflows.

## Who this is for

- Live events graphics operators  
- Slide wranglers and PowerPoint ops  
- Show callers and technical producers  
- Anyone running PowerPoint into LED walls, broadcast, or playback systems

## Philosophy

Backstage Ninja Tools is built by a **working live-events graphics operator**, not a SaaS team guessing how shows run.

The focus is on:
- Predictability  
- Speed  
- Clear information  
- Reducing last-minute surprises  

If a tool doesn’t earn its place in the rack, it doesn’t ship.

## Disclaimer

Backstage Ninja Tools are provided **without warranty of any kind, express or implied**.  
Use of the tools is **entirely at your own risk**.

Live events environments are complex and unpredictable. These tools are intended to assist experienced operators, not replace proper testing, rehearsal, or professional judgement.

Use the tools sensibly, test them properly, and always have a backup plan.
